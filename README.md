## 🧾 About Me

With 6.5+ years of experience driving operational performance at scale, I specialize in transforming messy, raw data into strategic insights that solve real business problems.

At Amazon, I worked across data ops, catalog quality, and counterfeit detection — building predictive models, automating processes, and designing dashboards that improved productivity, accuracy, and resolution times. My analytics solutions saved thousands of hours and were awarded with 8 consecutive performance recognitions.

Now pursuing a **Master’s in Business Analytics**, I’m enhancing that industry experience with advanced coursework in machine learning, optimization, data engineering, and decision analytics. I'm passionate about creating **data-powered solutions** that deliver measurable impact across customer experience, logistics, and strategy.
